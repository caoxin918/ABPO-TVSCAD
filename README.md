Instructions for use:

Based on the approximate simplified equations and boundary conditions of RTE, the finite element method is used to obtain AX=B. Among them, A is the system matrix and B is the observation vector.

Put A and B into the algorithm and solve to obtain X. Note that in order to obtain a more accurate X, some parameters in the algorithm may need to be adjusted.
